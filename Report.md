Unique code for this exercise can be found in exercise_game.py. The cloud service we used for this exercise was Adafruit IO. Adafruit IO utilizes a system called "Feeds," which allows for separate storage of different data streams. This feature enables us to upload our data to a specific feed, ensuring it remains organized and isolated from other data. Each feed acts as a designated container, where data is stored securely and can be accessed as needed.
