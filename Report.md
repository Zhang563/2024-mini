# Exercise 1

We found that `max_bright = 1000` and `min_bright = 40000` are the best values to make the LED bright in room light and dim in dark room.

# Exercise 2

We used the tones defined with frequency in [this example](https://www.coderdojotc.org/micropython/sound/04-play-scale/) to play a series of notes.

# Exercise 3
The unique code for this exercise can be found in exercise_game.py. The cloud service we used for this exercise was Adafruit IO. Adafruit IO utilizes a system called "Feeds," which allows for separate storage of different data streams. This feature enables us to upload our data to a specific feed, ensuring it remains organized and isolated from other data. Each feed acts as a designated container, where data is stored securely and can be accessed as needed.
